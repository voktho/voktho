### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Voktho
#### #Electronics Engineer #Hardware Security #Digital Electronics Design #RTL #FPGA
I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Central Florida, specializing in hardware security and trust. As a Research Assistant and ORCGS Doctoral Fellow, I am deeply committed to advancing research in hardware security, with particular focus on logic locking and eFPGA-based IP redaction.

My academic journey began at the prestigious Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. This foundation, combined with my passion for innovation, drives my current endeavor to address critical challenges in securing modern hardware systems.

I am always eager to collaborate on cutting-edge research and explore novel solutions to make hardware systems more secure and reliable.
